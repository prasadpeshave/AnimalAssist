# Animal-Assistant

# Concerns regarding animals-
There are close to a million strays in India, and over 100 of them meet with accidents every single day. Most of these die a painful death because help doesnâ€™t reach on time. We realised there is a massive void in the animal care space and there is no platform which can be used to rescue animals in distress who would otherwise be left to fend for themselves on the streets.

# Features and solutions- 
## 1) Animal In Distress
Incorporation of non profit organizations who will receive the photo and location of the animals directly.

## 2) Chatbot
Incorporation of non profit organizations who will receive the photo and location of the animals directly.

## 3) Vets Nearby
Helps user to look for nearby vets and clinics along with a chatbot that will act as a first aid. 

# Show stopper- 
Like never before, this project deals with non profit   organizations that can make a significant difference in aiding the injured animals. The user is free to help the animal as per their discretion and is also provided with a basic chatbot that can provide guidance. The lack of awareness regarding animal rescue that exists in the current scenario is made up for by this application along with actually taking the operation one step ahead.
